# ECE188_Project2
The main purpose of this project is to break neural network prediction by adding noises that are not easily detected by human eyes but are strong enough to get ML models to make wrong predictions

We tried with different pictures that were initially labeled correctly and after adding some noises to those pictures the predictions were incorrect and not remotely close, which means our attack on neural network was successful
